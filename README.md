# Open-Fortress-Tools
~~Basic tools for Open Fortress Sourcemod development.~~

 This ~~also comes with~~ is now a home for up-to-date gamedata for a proper SourceMod base install.

# THIS IS GOING TO BREAK. A LOT #
Open Fortress gets updated every 20 seconds so gamedata will break like there's no tomorrow. If/when they do break, you'll have to either live without, wait for me to actually update new gamedata, or get the signatures/offsets yourself.
