# Open-Fortress-Tools
Basic bins and tools for Open Fortress Sourcemod development.

## LINUX ONLY IM SORRY

This is a base for open fortress sourcemod compatibility. 

These repo includes the corrected tf2 bins for linux to allow it to work. Here's the repo if you wanna see what im adding/doing to make this stuff work: https://github.com/brysondev/hl2sdk/tree/tf2

# THIS IS GOING TO BREAK. A LOT #
Open Fortress gets updated every 20 seconds so gamedata will break like there's no tomorrow. If/when they do break, you'll have to either live without, wait for me to actually update new gamedata, or get the signatures/offsets yourself.


https://github.com/peace-maker/DHooks2 is required. Download the latest build and put it in your addons folder.
